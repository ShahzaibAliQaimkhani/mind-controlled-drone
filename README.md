# mind-controlled-drone
I find drones fascinating, those little flying machines that can do about anything. When I got the opportunity to do a project with cool technology I decided to make a boy's dream come true, controlling a drone with your mind.  In the research, I did for this project I didn't find any tutorials that covers how you can hack a drone controller easily. Most of the tutorials available are about how you can create your own drone using an Arduino or how to hack the transmission protocol.  This tutorial covers the most basic concept of hacking a PCB to control it digitally. The aim of this tutorial is to learn you the basic concepts that will enable you to experiment on your own with a drone and create something fun
